# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-18)

**Core value:** Instant, accurate pixel inspection of anything on screen — zero friction from invoke to dimension readout, whether launched from Raycast or a global hotkey.
**Current focus:** v2.0 Standalone App — Phase 18: Build System

## Current Position

Phase: 18 of 24 (Build System)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Key decisions for v2.0:
- Use KeyboardShortcuts 2.4.0 (Carbon-based, no Accessibility permission needed for registration)
- Use SMAppService.mainApp for launch at login (no helper bundle)
- App Sandbox must be disabled (CGEventTap + CGWindowListCreateImage incompatible)
- LSUIElement = YES in Info.plist (no Dock icon, no Cmd+Tab entry)
- RunMode enum added to OverlayCoordinator (~15-line change, not a rewrite)
- CursorManager.shared.restore() called at START of every run() (singleton state leak prevention)
- setActivationPolicy(.accessory) set once in applicationDidFinishLaunching, removed from coordinator
- [Phase 18-build-system]: open class OverlayCoordinator (not package) required for cross-module subclassing by DesignRuler bridge target
- [Phase 18-build-system]: Package.swift updated to macOS 14 minimum and products array declaring DesignRulerCore library

### Research Flags (from SUMMARY.md)

- Phase 18: Verify exact set of files with @raycast entry points before moving files
- Phase 22: CGEventTap session cleanup — verify disable/re-enable pattern between sessions
- Phase 24: Sparkle 2.8.1 XPC service config — verify binaryTarget SPM pattern and EdDSA key setup

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Raycast extension detection path (LOW confidence): `~/Library/Application Support/com.raycast.macos/extensions/` is inferred, not documented. Implement as best-effort heuristic in Phase 23.

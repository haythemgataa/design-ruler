# Requirements: Design Ruler Enhancement Milestone

**Defined:** 2026-02-13
**Core Value:** Instant, accurate pixel inspection of anything on screen — zero friction from Raycast invoke to dimension readout.

## v1 Requirements

All v1 requirements shipped and validated.

### Robustness

- [x] **RBST-01**: Debug fputs statements removed entirely (Raycast always builds debug config, so `#if DEBUG` gating is ineffective) — v1.0
- [x] **RBST-02**: All NSCursor push/pop/hide/unhide calls routed through centralized CursorManager with explicit state tracking — v1.0
- [x] **RBST-03**: CursorManager guarantees cursor is fully restored (visible, correct type) on all exit paths including SIGTERM — v1.0
- [x] **RBST-04**: Process self-terminates after 10 minutes of inactivity to prevent zombie processes — v1.0

### Visual Feedback

- [x] **VFBK-01**: When selection snap fails, the selection overlay shakes horizontally (macOS login rejection idiom) before fading out — v1.0
- [x] **VFBK-02**: Selection overlay dimension pill is clamped to screen bounds so it never renders partially off-screen — v1.0

### Discoverability

- [x] **DISC-01**: User can press backspace to dismiss the hint bar; a brief "Press ? for help" message appears and auto-fades — v1.0
- [x] **DISC-02**: User can press `?` to re-enable the hint bar after dismissal — v1.0
- [x] **DISC-03**: Hint bar dismissal and re-enable state persists across sessions via UserDefaults — v1.0
- [x] **DISC-04**: On launch with hint bar previously dismissed, a brief "Press ? for help" message appears and auto-fades — v1.0

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

### Edge Detection

- **EDGE-01**: User can adjust edge detection sensitivity (tolerance) for noisy backgrounds
- **EDGE-02**: Smart edge correction algorithm has unit test coverage

### Performance

- **PERF-01**: Multi-monitor windows are created lazily when cursor enters a new screen

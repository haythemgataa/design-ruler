# Milestone v1.1: Hint Bar Redesign — Audit Report

**Status:** PASSED
**Audited:** 2026-02-14
**Milestone:** v1.1 Hint Bar Redesign (Phases 6-8)

## Requirements Coverage

| # | Requirement | Phase | Status |
|---|-------------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Hint bar redesign with liquid glass background and launch-to-collapse animation | 7+8+interactive | Satisfied |
| 2 | New keycap sizes and layout (arrows 26x11, shift 40x25, esc 32x25) | 7-01 | Satisfied |
| 3 | ESC keycap in main bar with reddish tint (dark/light mode aware) | 7-01 | Satisfied |
| 4 | Bar split animation: full text → two keycap-only bars (arrows+shift left, esc right) | 8-01+interactive | Satisfied |
| 5 | Liquid glass on macOS 26+, vibrancy fallback on older versions | 7-01+interactive | Satisfied |
| 6 | Remove backspace-dismiss / ? re-enable system (preference-only hide) | 6 | Satisfied |

**Score: 6/6 requirements satisfied**

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Plan | Status | Score | Verified |
|-------|------|--------|-------|----------|
| 06 — Remove Help Toggle System | 01 | passed | 3/3 | 2026-02-14 |
| 07 — Hint Bar Visual Redesign | 01 | passed | 5/5 | 2026-02-14 |
| 07 — Hint Bar Visual Redesign | 02 | (no separate verification — covered by 07-01) | — | — |
| 08 — Launch-to-Collapse Animation | 01 | passed (human_needed for visual) | 6/6 | 2026-02-14 |

**All phases verified. No critical gaps.**

## Post-Phase Interactive Work

Significant work was done interactively after Phase 8 completion (same session):

1. **Liquid glass morph (macOS 26+):** Replaced NSAnimationContext crossfade with SwiftUI `GlassEffectContainer` + `.glassEffect()` + `.glassEffectID()` for native glass morph animation
2. **Two-layer rendering hack:** Bottom layer (glass morph with visible text, invisible keycaps for sizing) + top layer (visible keycaps, invisible text for spacing) — enables both glass split and smooth keycap sliding
3. **3-second minimum display delay:** Expanded bar stays visible for at least 3 seconds after launch before collapsing, even if user moves mouse earlier
4. **Pre-macOS 26 fallback:** Retains the original NSAnimationContext crossfade path

All interactive work verified via integration checker — fully wired and building clean.

## Integration Check

**12/12 exports connected across phases:**

| Export | From | To | Status |
|--------|------|----|--------|
| hideHintBar preference | TypeScript/Phase 6 | Phase 7/8 | Connected |
| BarState enum | Phase 7-02 | Phase 8 | Connected |
| setBarState() | Phase 7-02 | Phase 8 | Connected |
| animateToCollapsed() | Phase 8 | RulerWindow | Connected |
| collapseHintBar() | Phase 8 | Ruler | Connected |
| isAnimatingCollapse guard | Phase 8 | updatePosition() | Connected |
| Glass panel infrastructure | Phase 7-01 | Phase 7-02 | Connected |
| Adaptive appearance | Phase 7-01 | Phase 7-02 | Connected |
| Screenshot threading | Phase 7-01 | Ruler/RulerWindow | Connected |
| HintBarGlassRoot | Interactive | setupMorphPath() | Connected |
| state.isCollapsed | Interactive | BarState/SwiftUI | Connected |
| minExpandedDuration | Interactive | handleFirstMove() | Connected |

**Orphaned exports: 0**
**Missing connections: 0**

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| Launch → expanded bar → first move → 3s delay → collapse | Complete |
| hideHintBar=true → no hint bar | Complete |
| Collapse → slide animation (no overlap) | Complete |
| Key press → keycap animation (both states) | Complete |
| macOS 26+ morph vs pre-26 crossfade | Complete |
| Reduce Motion → instant collapse | Complete |

**6/6 flows verified end-to-end. No breaks found.**

## Tech Debt

None accumulated. All phases clean with no TODOs, FIXMEs, or placeholder code.

## Build Status

Swift build: PASSED (clean, no warnings)
